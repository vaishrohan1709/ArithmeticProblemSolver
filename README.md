# ArithmeticProblemSolver
This project seeks to explore the use of different natural language processing approaches to build a model for
automatically solving elementary arithmetic word problems. The task falls under the field of Question
Answering, which is a subfield of Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing. As such, the steps to
returning an answer to a question will involve the simplification of the input text if necessary. This serves to
facilitate the extraction of relevant information such as subjects, objects and quantities from the input text. The
extraction step is then followed by the processing of the relevant information to arrive at an answer.
